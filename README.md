**U-Boot** (short for Universal Bootloader) is an open-source boot loader software that is commonly used in embedded systems and devices.
It is responsible for initializing the hardware and starting the operating system on the device.

**U-Boot environment** (often referred to as "env") is a set of variables that are stored in non-volatile memory and used by U-Boot at boot time. These variables contain configuration information, such as the boot device, kernel parameters, and network settings.

**The Linux kernel (uImage)** is a compressed image of the Linux kernel that contains the necessary components to start the operating system.
 It includes the kernel code, device drivers, and other essential components. The uImage format includes a header that provides information about the kernel image, such as its size, load address, and entry point. It is used by U-Boot to load the kernel image into memory and start execution. The use of a compressed uImage helps to reduce the size of the kernel image, making it more suitable for embedded systems with limited storage capacity.

**The root filesystem** is the top-level directory of the filesystem. It must contain all of the files required to boot the Linux system before other filesystems are mounted. It must include all of the required executables and libraries required to boot the remaining filesystems.

**Overlay** is used to create a read-only root file system that can be overlaid with a read-write file system. This allows the system to boot from a read-only file system, which is more secure and reliable, while still allowing users to make changes and store data in a separate overlay file system.

### Backup factory firmware

a) Clear the space on the microSD card for the backup dump  
b) Insert the prepared microSD card into the camera
c) Connect the camera to the computer with the USB-UART adapter
d) Read the content of spi flash to SoC RAM with OpenIPC U-Boot uploaded with OpenIPC BURN utility to camera
e) Write the read out spi flash content from SoC RAM to the microSD card
f) Take the microSD card from the camera and insert it into the computer
g) Ignore the format proposal!
h) Read the content of the microSD card to the computer

                                                   Warning! 
DO NOT IGNORE ANY OF THE STEPS! ALSO IT IS INADMISSIBLE TO HAVE ANY ERRORS DURING EXECUTION OF ACTIONS AND COMMANDS!
   
1) Download windows dd utility (allows the flexible copying of data under in a win32 environment) 
    http://www.chrysocome.net/dd direct link http://www.chrysocome.net/downloads/dd-0.6beta3.zip
    and extract it to appropriate location.
2) Prepare microSD card: 
    Connect microSD card to Windows PC. Check the letter of microSD card in windows file explorer.
    
After next operation all previous information on microSD card will be lost!

Open windows terminal window (`cmd`) and issue command:

`dd if=/dev/zero of=\\.\e:  bs=512 count=65536 --progress`

This command clear head part of the microSD card with zeros, where `e` the letter of microSD card in windows file explorer. Where `dd` - utility itself, `if` - input file (with zeros), `of` output file (microSD card), `bs` - block size (bytes), `count` - number of blocks. 
 512*65536=33554432 bytes=32 MegaBytes will be cleared from the begining of microSD.


3) Insert prepared microSD card into camera microSD card slot.

4) Load OpenIPC hi3518ev200 U-Boot with OpenIPC BURN utility. Video at https://youtu.be/er9K9XqkQgM

5) Execute from PuTTY command line (line by line and not all together) :

`mw.b 0x82000000 ff 0x1000000`

`sf probe 0`

`sf read 0x82000000 0x0 0x1000000`

`mmc write 0 0x82000000 0x10 0x8000`

where:

`mw.b 0x82000000 ff 0x1000000` clear a section of SoC RAM 0x1000000 (hex) bytes for a 16MB chip with starting address 0x82000000 with FF

`sf probe 0` select serial flash as current device

`sf read 0x82000000 0x0 0x1000000` reading whole amount of data from spi flash memory chip into SoC RAM

`mmc write 0 0x82000000 0x10 0x8000` save the copied data from SoC RAM to the microSD card. The data will be written directly to the microSD card registers, bypassing the partition table. To avoid conflicts when later accessing the card data from the PC, you must make an offset of 8 kilobytes from the beginning of the card (8 * 1024 = 8192 bytes or 16 blocks of 512 bytes, or 0x10 blocks in hexadecimal representation).

6) Save from microSD card to HDD:
    Take the microSD card from the camera and insert it into the Windows PC.
    Ignore the format question after insertion!!!
    Open windows terminal window (cmd) and issue command:

      `dd if=\\.\e: of=CIP37210-fullflash.bin  bs=512 skip=16 count=32768 --progress`

   The size of the `CIP37210-fullflash.bin` file should be 16777216 bytes = 16 MegaBytes. 
   If not so, repeat from step 2.
   Save CIP37210-fullflash.bin file to safe place.
 
 Each dump is unique, because it contains unique camera id and keys. If you flash someone else's dump - it will be 
 a clone, which means that the two devices will not be able to work simultaneously in the application on the phone.

### Flashing OpenIPC U-Boot

1) Connect the microSD card to the PC and divide it into two partitions. The card can be of any size, but the first partition must not exceed 2GB. 
   Format the first partition of the microSD card as FAT/FAT16 (2GB limit). FAT stands for File Allocation Table.
2) Download u-boot-hi3518ev200-universal.bin and copy file to the first partition of the microSD card:
        https://github.com/OpenIPC/firmware/releases/download/latest/u-boot-hi3518ev200-universal.bin
3) Insert microSD card in to camera microSD card slot.
4) [Connect](https://github.com/OpenIPC/device-cip-37210/blob/main/README.md#connecting-usb-uart-adapter) the camera to the computer with the USB-UART adapter.
5) Insert prepared microSD card (with `u-boot-hi3518ev200-universal.bin`) into camera microSD card slot.
    If not inserted before powering up the camera then card will not appear even after `mmc rescan`.
6) Load OpenIPC u-boot-hi3518ev200-universal.bin U-Boot with OpenIPC BURN utility to SoC RAM. 
    Video at https://youtu.be/er9K9XqkQgM
7) From this step without a backup it will be impossible to restore the factory firmware!

`sf probe 0` select serial flash as current device

`sf erase 0x0 0x50000` erase 0x50000 bytes from 0x0 address on the current selected serial flash

`sf write 0x82000000 0x0 ${filesize}` write loaded file from 0x0 address till loaded file size to the current selected serial flash starting from address 0x82000000 in SoC RAM

`reset` reboot camera

No errors should appear! 
If not so, repeat from step 6. 
After this step the camera should boot from the spi flash with OpenIPC U-Boot. 
To enter OpenIPC U-boot console hit Ctrl+C during message appear. 
Issue command:
`run setnor16m`
it will setup partion for 16 megabyte spi flash.
Camera will reboot immediatly.

### WiFi setup

**Manual setup** 

1) Download, extract and copy WiFi module to microSD card

[rtl8188fu.zip](https://github.com/OpenIPC/device-cip-37210/files/11104201/rtl8188fu.zip)


2) Copy WiFi module to camera `/lib/modules/4.9.37/extra/rtl8188fu.ko` via microsd card (camera should be [connected](https://github.com/OpenIPC/device-cip-37210/blob/main/README.md#connecting-usb-uart-adapter) to PC via USB-UART)

3) Edit /etc/network/interfaces 

```
# Interfaces
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
pre-up echo 3 > /sys/class/gpio/export
pre-up echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio3/direction
pre-up echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio3/value
pre-up modprobe mac80211
pre-up sleep 1
pre-up insmod /lib/modules/4.9.37/extra/rtl8188fu.ko
pre-up sleep 1
pre-up wpa_passphrase "OpenIPC_NFS" "project2021" >/tmp/wpa_supplicant.conf
pre-up sed -i '2i \\tscan_ssid=1' /tmp/wpa_supplicant.conf
pre-up ifconfig wlan0 up
pre-up wpa_supplicant -B -Dnl80211 -iwlan0 -c/tmp/wpa_supplicant.conf
pre-up sleep 3
post-down killall -q wpa_supplicant
```

In this example default camera WiFi SSID for connection to router as client (not as access point): `OpenIPC_NFS` password: `project2021`

You need to change values to yours accordingly.

For this purposes you can use `vi` editor.

Short hints:

After you have opened file `/etc/network/interfaces` via `vi` editor (`vi /etc/network/interfaces`) use `i` character on keyboard to switch to 'edit' mode
then using arrows on keyboard to move the cursor to values names 

make changes

to save your changes to the file press `:` -> `w` -> `q` -> `enter`
if you don't want to save changes and just want to exit `vi` editor then press `:` -> `q` -> `!` -> `enter`

4) Reboot    

5) Wait until camera boot and check on your router web page connected camera and write somewhere obtained camera's IP address.

**Auto setup**

1) Copy files to sd card

2) Edit /etc/network/interfaces on sd card (donât forget save file in UTF8 encoding , for example use Notepad++)

```
# Interfaces
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
pre-up echo 3 > /sys/class/gpio/export
pre-up echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio3/direction
pre-up echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio3/value
pre-up modprobe mac80211
pre-up sleep 1
pre-up insmod /lib/modules/4.9.37/extra/rtl8188fu.ko
pre-up sleep 1
pre-up wpa_passphrase "OpenIPC_NFS" "project2021" >/tmp/wpa_supplicant.conf
pre-up sed -i '2i \\tscan_ssid=1' /tmp/wpa_supplicant.conf
pre-up ifconfig wlan0 up
pre-up wpa_supplicant -B -Dnl80211 -iwlan0 -c/tmp/wpa_supplicant.conf
pre-up sleep 3
post-down killall -q wpa_supplicant
```

In this example default camera WiFi SSID for connection to router as client (not as access point): `OpenIPC_NFS` password: `project2021`
You need to change values to yours accordingly.

3) Turn off the camera.

4) [Connect](https://github.com/OpenIPC/device-cip-37210/blob/main/README.md#connecting-usb-uart-adapter) the camera to the computer with the USB-UART adapter. 

5) Insert prepared microSD card to the camera.

6) Power on a camera.

7) Wait until camera boot and check on your router web page connected camera and write somewhere obtained camera's IP address.

8) Pull out microSD card.

### Rolling back to factory firmware from backup

1) Connect the microSD card to the PC and divide it into two partitions. The card can be of any size, but the first partition must not exceed 2GB. 
   Format the first partition of the microSD card as FAT/FAT16 (2GB limit). FAT stands for File Allocation Table.

2) Copy fullflash file (`fullflash-CIP37210.bin`) to microSD card. It is assumed that you have made a backup as indicated in the beginning.

3) Insert microSD card into camera microSD card slot.

4) Power on the camera.

5) Enter OpenIPC U-boot console by hitting Ctrl+C during message appear.

6) Execute from OpenIPC U-boot command line (line by line and not all together):

`mw.b 0x82000000 ff 0x1000000`

`fatls mmc 0`

`fatload mmc 0 0x82000000 fullflash-CIP37210.bin`

`sf probe 0` 

`sf erase 0x0 0x1000000`

`sf write 0x82000000 0x0 ${filesize}`

`reset`

Where:

`mw.b 0x82000000 ff 0x1000000` clear a section of SoC RAM 0x1000000 (hex) bytes for a 16MB chip with starting address 0x82000000 with FF

`fatls mmc 0` fullflash-CIP37210.bin should appear in output

`fatload mmc 0 0x82000000 fullflash-CIP37210.bin` load `fullflash-CIP37210.bin` file from microSD card to the SoC RAM starting from address 0x82000000

`sf probe 0` select serial flash as current device

`sf erase 0x0 0x1000000` erase 0x1000000 bytes from 0x0 address on the current selected serial flash (whole 16MB spi flash)

`sf write 0x82000000 0x0 ${filesize}` write loaded file from 0x0 address till loaded file size to the current selected serial flash starting from address 0x82000000 in SoC RAM

`reset` reboot camera

No errors should appear! 

If not so, repeat from step `6` or you can do it from OpenIPC BURN utility same way (in this case backup  `fullflash-CIP37210.bin` file should already exist on microsd card before powering up).

After this step the camera should boot from factory firmware.

Each dump is unique, because it contains unique camera id and keys. If you flash someone else's dump - it will be 
a clone, which means that the two devices will not be able to work simultaneously in the application on the phone.
